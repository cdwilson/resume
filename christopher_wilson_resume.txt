Experience
----------

## Vocational

2010 – Present
Hardware Engineer, Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA.

* Lead design engineer for Connected Grid Endpoint (CGE) SDK hardware reference design.
-- Designed ARM Cortex-M3 based modular reference designs for 802.15.4g 900MHz RF and PLC smart grid endpoints. Schematic capture in Cadence Concept.
-- Managed ECAD and MCAD contractors during PCB layout and enclosure design.
-- Responsible for NPI engineering using Cisco manufacturing tools.
-- Worked closely with Cisco Developer Network (CDN) partners to review partner hardware designs for "Cisco Compatible" certification.

* Developed the worlds largest closed-circuit 900MHz RF and PLC mesh network testbed consisting of over 5000 endpoint devices.
-- Designed sophisticated custom rack-mount chassis and internal backplane PCB with embedded Linux ARM controller, providing networked back-channel and instruction-level JTAG/SWD debug to every endpoint in the testbed.
-- Modified Linux kernel source code and BSP to support custom backplane PCB hardware.
-- Developed user space applications in C for CLI device control.
-- Developed Python CGI web application for device management from a web browser.

* Managed DevOps for the Connected Grid Endpoint firmware team.
-- Set up and maintained Git (SCM), Jenkins (CI and release build), and Gerrit (code review) servers.
-- Developed build scripts in Windows batch and Bash for a hybrid Cygwin/IAR firmware build server.


2007 – 2010
Hardware Engineer, Arch Rock (acquired by Cisco Systems), San Francisco, CA.

* Responsible for transition to agile in-house hardware design and manufacturing. Adopted industry standard EDA, DFM, and PLM tools and methodology to scale hardware development for production.

* Designed 802.15.4 2.4GHz “PhyNet” wireless sensor motes and network interface cards.
-- Schematic capture and PCB layout using OrCAD Capture and Cadence Allegro. - Board level bring-up and verification using lab test equipment.
-- Hand assembled and reworked prototype PCBs.

* Developed embedded TinyOS firmware applications in nesC (network embedded systems C) for hardware bring-up and manufacturing test. Debugged and optimized production runtime firmware with special emphasis on low power operation.

* Designed and built a fully isolated wireless mesh testbed with reconfigurable RF topologies.
-- Developed integration test scripts in Ruby to allow automated deployment of embedded firmware for devices in the testbed.
-- Tightly integrated the testbed with Buildbot based continuous integration to facilitate automated regression testing for the full mesh network stack.


2006
Undergraduate Researcher, Berkeley Wireless Research Center, Berkeley, CA.

* Implemented distributed adaptive duty cycling algorithm in nesC for Telos wireless sensor motes running TinyOS 1.x operating system.


2004
Interim Engineering Intern, Qualcomm, San Diego, CA.

* Developed framework for an intranet website used to track internal development of FFA hardware.


## Miscellaneous

2010 – Present
Proprietor, Flying Camp Design, La Jolla, CA.

* Designed open source hardware boot-strap loader (BSL) programmer for TI MSP430 MCUs.
* Manufactured and sold over 100 programmers internationally.
* Developed open source cross-platform BSL GUI utility in Python.


2010 – Present
Partner, Moteware, Berkeley, CA.

* Founded with a group of former graduate students at UC Berkeley.
* Helped manage sales, support, IT, and manufacturing.
