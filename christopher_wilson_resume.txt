Experience
----------

## Vocational

2018 – Present
Technical Product Manager, Tempo Automation, San Francisco, CA.

2010 – 2018
Hardware Engineer, Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA.
Internet of Things (IoT) BU

* Lead design engineer for Connected Grid Endpoint (CGE) SDK hardware reference design.
-- Designed ARM Cortex-M & Tensilica based modular reference designs for IEEE 802.15.4g 800/900 MHz RF and 1901.2 PLC smart grid endpoint devices.
-- Managed external ECAD and MCAD contractors during PCB layout and enclosure design.
-- Responsible for NPI engineering using Cisco manufacturing tools.
-- Worked closely with Cisco Developer Network (CDN) partners to review partner hardware designs for "Cisco Compatible" certification.

* Co-designed Cisco’s first industrial "Fog" compute server module, allowing customers to
utilize Cisco IOx hypervisor architecture to run Internet of Things (IoT) applications inside CGR 1000 series routers.
-- Designed interface logic boards for AMD G-Series COM Express module to meet stringent
worldwide and smart grid performance requirements for harsh operating environments.
-- Validated HW design specifications over industrial operating temperature range, and performed physical layer qualification testing for SATA, Gigabit Ethernet, and USB
interfaces.
-- Worked with internal ECAD and MCAD teams to complete PCB layout and chassis
design.
-- Guided operations team to transition the product from NPI to production.

* Developed the worlds largest closed-circuit RF and PLC mesh network testbed consisting of over 5000 endpoint devices.
-- Designed sophisticated custom rack-mount chassis and internal backplane PCB with embedded Linux ARM controller, providing networked back-channel and instruction-level JTAG/SWD debug to every endpoint in the testbed.
-- Modified Linux kernel source code and BSP to support custom backplane PCB hardware.
-- Developed user space applications in C for CLI device control.
-- Developed Python CGI web application for device management from a web browser.

* Managed DevOps for the Connected Grid Endpoint firmware team.
-- Set up and maintained Git (SCM), Jenkins (CI and release build), and Gerrit (code review) servers.
-- Developed build scripts in Windows batch and Bash for a hybrid Cygwin/IAR firmware build server.


2007 – 2010
Hardware Engineer, Arch Rock (acquired by Cisco Systems), San Francisco, CA.

* Responsible for transition to agile in-house hardware design and manufacturing. Adopted industry standard EDA, DFM, and PLM tools and methodology to scale hardware development for production.

* Designed 802.15.4 2.4GHz “PhyNet” wireless sensor motes and network interface cards.
-- Schematic capture and PCB layout using OrCAD Capture and Cadence Allegro. 
-- Board level bring-up and verification using lab test equipment.
-- Hand assembled and reworked prototype PCBs.

* Developed embedded TinyOS firmware applications in nesC (network embedded systems C) for hardware bring-up and manufacturing test. Debugged and optimized production runtime firmware with special emphasis on low power operation.

* Designed and built a fully isolated wireless mesh testbed with reconfigurable RF topologies.
-- Developed integration test scripts in Ruby to allow automated deployment of embedded firmware for devices in the testbed.
-- Tightly integrated the testbed with Buildbot based continuous integration to facilitate automated regression testing for the full mesh network stack.


2006
Undergraduate Researcher, Berkeley Wireless Research Center, Berkeley, CA.

* Implemented distributed adaptive duty cycling algorithm in nesC for Telos wireless sensor motes running TinyOS 1.x operating system.


2004
Interim Engineering Intern, Qualcomm, San Diego, CA.

* Developed framework for an intranet website used to track internal development of FFA hardware.


## Hobby

2010 – Present
Proprietor, Flying Camp Design, Castro Valley, CA.
Indie hardware and software design

* Designed open source hardware boot-strap loader (BSL) programmer for TI MSP430 MCUs.
* Manufactured and sold over 100 programmers internationally.
* Developed open source cross-platform BSL GUI utility in Python.


2010 – 2015
Partner, Moteware, Berkeley, CA.
Open source hardware disseminator for the academic research community

* Founded with a group of former graduate students at UC Berkeley.
* Helped manage sales, support, IT, and manufacturing.
